**Disclaimer** This Docker image is not done yet. I'm pondering to move some stuff into the Dockerfile (if feasible) in order to reduce the number of manual interventions. Also pending: asking Oracle for permission to build this image and push it into Docker Hub (including the instantclient) - I perceive that Oracle might be a bit edgy about things like this.

# redash_oracle_docker
A docker container / image integrating Redash with Oracle 12c instantclient drivers
